# Overview

Newton is a project of the Linux Foundation and aims to be governed in a transparent, accessible way for the benefit of the community. All participation in this project is open and not bound to corporate affiliation. Participants are all bound to the Linux Foundation [Code of Conduct](https://lfprojects.org/policies/code-of-conduct/).

# Contributing to Newton

Newton welcomes contributions from the community. For learning about ways to contribute, please refer to the contribution guidelines of the respective respository; for example, the newton repository [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/newton-physics/newton/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Legal Requirements

Newton follows the open source software best practice policies of the Linux Foundation.

## License

Newton is licensed under the [Apache License, version 2.0](LICENSE.md) license. Contributions to Newton should be compatible with that standard license. Newton documentation will be received and made available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

## Contributor License Agreements

Developers who wish to contribute code to be considered for inclusion in Newton must first complete a **Contributor License Agreement**.

Newton uses [EasyCLA](https://lfcla.com/) for managing CLAs, which automatically checks to ensure CLAs are signed by a contributor before a commit can be merged.

* If you are an individual writing the code on your own time and you're SURE you are the sole owner of any intellectual property you contribute, you can sign the CLA as [an individual contributor](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/contributors/individual-contributor) (ICLA).

* If you are writing the code as part of your job, or if there is any possibility that your employers might think they own any intellectual property you create, then you should use the [Corporate Contributor](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/contributors/corporate-contributor) License Agreement (CCLA).

The Newton CLAs are the standard forms used by Linux Foundation projects and [recommended by the ASWF TAC](https://tac.aswf.io/process/contributing.html#contributor-license-agreement-cla). The Newton ICLA and CCLA are available in the [legal subfolder](legal).

# Project Roles

The Newton Project defines four project roles:

1. Community Members
2. Project Members
3. Maintainers
4. Technical Steering Committee (TSC) Members

See list in [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) for project members and their roles.

## Community Members

The Community Member role is equivalent to the Contributor role in the [charter](legal/Charter.pdf). It is the starting role for anyone participating in the project in any of the ways described in the [Contributing to Newton](#contributing-to-newton) Section above.

## Project Members

The Project Member role is the equivalent of the "Committer" role in the [charter](legal/Charter.pdf).

This role enables the participant to review and approve pull requests as part of the project-members team of the newton-physics GitHub organization, but also comes with the obligation to be a responsible leader in the community.

### Process for Becoming a Project Member

* Show your experience with the codebase through contributions and engagement on the project communication channels.
* Request to become a Project Member.
* Have the majority of Project Members approve you becoming a Project Member, or be assigned the Project Member role at the discretion of a Maintainer or the TSC.
* Your name is added to the list of Project Members in the [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file for the project and you are added to the newton-physics GitHub organization project-members team.

### Project Member responsibilities

* Monitor project-related communication channels such as email aliases, GitHub discussions, etc.
* Triage GitHub issues and manage GitHub discussions.
* Perform pull request reviews.
* Make sure that ongoing PRs are moving forward at the right pace or close them.
* Remain an active contributor to the project in general and the code base in particular.

### When Does a Project Member Lose Project Member Status?

If a Project Member is no longer interested or cannot perform the Project Member duties listed above, they should volunteer to be moved to emeritus/emerita status. In extreme cases, this can also occur by a vote of the TSC per [the voting process below](#conflict-resolution-and-voting).

## Maintainers

In addition to the rights and obligations of Project Members, this role grants maintenance access to all repositories in the project.

### Process for Becoming a Maintainer

* Be a Project Member and request to become a Maintainer.
* Have the majority of Maintainers approve you becoming a Maintainer, or be assigned the Maintainer role at the discretion of the TSC.
* Your name is added to the list of Maintainers in the [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file for the project and you are added to the Maintainers team.

### Maintainer Responsibilities

* All responsibilities of Project Members.
* Manage repository settings like branch protection rules, and manage project-wide settings and teams.
* Oversee health of all project repositories.
* Ensure compliance with project policies and community guidelines.
* Coordinate and execute releases, and make sure release processes are followed and documented.

### When Does a Maintainer Lose Maintainer Status?

The conditions and process are the same as for Project Members, see above.

## Technical Steering Committee (TSC) member

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) oversees the overall technical direction of Newton, as defined in the [charter](legal/Charter.pdf).

TSC members consist of project members that have been nominated by the TSC, with a supermajority of members required to have a member elected to be a TSC member.

The TSC will elect two co-chairs among its members. The responsibility of the co-chairs is to coordinate TSC duties, and preside over TSC meetings and communicate meeting summaries and decisions to the community.

A voting member of the TSC may nominate a successor in the event that such voting member decides to leave the TSC, and the TSC, including the departing member, shall confirm or reject such nomination by a vote. In the event that the departing member's nomination for successor is rejected by vote of the TSC, the departing member shall be entitled to continue nominating successors until one such successor is confirmed by vote of the TSC. If the departing member fails or is unable to nominate a successor, the TSC may nominate one on the departing member's behalf.

All meetings of the TSC are open to participation by any member of the Newton community. Meeting times are listed in the Newton community calendar.

# Release Process

Project releases will occur on a scheduled basis as agreed to by the TSC.

# Conflict resolution and voting

In general, we prefer that technical issues and role memberships are amicably worked out between the persons involved. If a dispute cannot be decided independently, the TSC can be called in to decide an issue. If the TSC themselves cannot decide an issue, the issue will be resolved by voting. The voting process is a simple majority in which each TSC member receives one vote.

# Communication

This project, just like all of open source, is a global community. In addition to the LF [Code of Conduct](https://lfprojects.org/policies/code-of-conduct/), this project will:

* Keep all communication on open channels (mailing list, forums, chat).
* Be respectful of time and language differences between community members (such as scheduling meetings, email/issue responsiveness, etc).
* Ensure tools are able to be used by community members regardless of their region.

If you have concerns about communication challenges for this project, please contact the TSC.
