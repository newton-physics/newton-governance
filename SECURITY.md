# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We value the security of our code and the safety of our users. If you discover a security vulnerability in any repository within the **newton-physics** GitHub organization, or in any of our dependencies, we encourage you to report it.

- Please use the **Security** tab in the relevant GitHub repository to submit your vulnerability report.  
- This process ensures your report is handled confidentially and reaches the appropriate maintainers.

## Our Commitment

- All submitted security reports will be reviewed promptly by our team.  
- For confirmed vulnerabilities, we will issue a security advisory through GitHub to inform the community and provide guidance or patches as needed.

Thank you for helping us keep our projects and users safe!
